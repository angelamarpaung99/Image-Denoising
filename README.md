# Image-Denoising
Implementation of image denoising.

Datasets can be found in "dataset". 

Datasets consist of 10 original bone x-ray images.

Images were then converted to grayscale images and given white gaussian noise.

Image denoising was implemented by using Median Filter and Gaussian Filter.
Results can be found in "output".

PSNR is used as metrics to compare which filter works better.
Implementation can be found can be found in "image-denoising.ipynb" as jupyter notebook file.
